        <p class="c2">
            <span class="c1">
                Metal Wallet is software that (a) generates Wallet addresses and encrypted private
                keys that you may use to store, send and receive &nbsp;supported cryptographically
                secured tokens (the &ldquo;Virtual Currency&rdquo;)..
            </span>
            <span class="c1">
                Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities. An encrypted backup of certain
                information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in Keystore JSON
                format.
            </span>
            <span class="c1">
                The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together, they can be used
                to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet address. You
                are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any
                mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. You must keep your Wallet
                address, mnemonic (backup) phrase, and private key access information secure.
                Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated
                with the Wallet. Metal Wallet Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval. Metal Wallet
                stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password,
                encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase
                associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password
                retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember
                your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address
                and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any
                Virtual Currency you have associated with such a Wallet address will become
                inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password. Virtual Currency Transactions.
                In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be
                confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency&rsquo;s associated public
                Blockchains. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by
                independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no
                control over the
            </span>
            <span class="c1">networks</span>
            <span class="c0">
                and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you
                submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using Metal Wallet, you
                acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed,
                or may be substantially delayed, by the Blockchains networks. Metal Wallet Does Not
                Store or Transmit Virtual Currency. We do not store, send, or receive Virtual
                Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the Blockchains
                and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that Metal Wallet
                can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency. Accuracy of
                Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any information you
                provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that
                we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with
                any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage
                you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a
                Virtual Currency.

                maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and keystore and will be fully
                responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to
                immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any
                other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
                your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are
                strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or
                control over your Wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the
                following: (a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website
                or online service; (b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or
                safeguard your private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive
                which, all users, especially users who have more than $100,000 USD in assets, are
                encouraged to do even if they are utilizing the Services&rsquo; backup
                functionality; (c) maintaining the security of your Wallet by protecting the private
                key and mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet by, for example,
                limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and (d) promptly notifying us if
                you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet.
